# PES6-AFS-Tools
Code which opens AFS and related files for PS2 era PES titles.

I planned to make [GGS-like](https://www.moddingway.com/file/290.html) open source app, which would implement some features from [DKZ Studio](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/dkz-studio-v092-beta), however due to lack of time, I decided to release these snippets as is (for learning and documentation purposes).

TXS class is missing [swizzle and unswizzle](http://ps2linux.no-ip.info/playstation2-linux.com/docs/howto/display_docef7c.html?docid=75) methods.
